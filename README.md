# Predicting-the-Quality-of-Bordeaux-Wines

Bordeaux wines are widely believed to taste better when they are older, so there's an incentive to store young wines until they are mature. The main problem is that it is hard to determine the quality of the wine when it is so young just by tasting it, since the taste will change so significantly by the time it will actually be consumed. This is why wine tasters and experts are helpful. They taste the wines and then predict which ones will be the best wines later. The question is to prepare a analytics system that model this process better and make stronger predictions?

We can see that we have a data frame with 25 observations of seven different variables from the data set provided in this repository. Year gives the year the wine was produced, and it’s just a unique identifier for each observation. Price is the dependent variable we’re trying to predict. And WinterRain, AGST, HarvestRain, Age, and FrancePop are the independent variables we’ll use to predict Price.
